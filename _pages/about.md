I'm a Ph.D. student at Kyungpook National University, advised by Prof. Hyun-Chul Kim and Prof. Minho Lee. I am currently focused on advancing **the efficiency and generalization of sequence models**. My work involves **memory-augmented neural architectures** and **modular representation learning** for AI, aiming to enable capabilities such as:
- `Long-context reasoning`,
- `Systematic` or `compositional generalization`.

If you're interested in talking about the above topic, feel free to contact me :blush: Here is my [CV](../assets/pdf/cv_taewon.pdf)!
