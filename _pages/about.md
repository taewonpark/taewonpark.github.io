I'm a Ph.D. student at Kyungpook National University, advised by Prof. Minho Lee. My research interest is developing reusable, disentangled, and **compositional modular** representations for **compressive memory**-based AI architecture. Therefore, I am currently focusing on the following topics.
- Compressive Memory, or Memory Augmented Neural Network
- Structured Representation Learning
- Compositional Generalization, or Systematic Generalization

If you're interested in collaborating on research projects related to compressive memory, feel free to contact me :blush: Here is my [CV](../assets/pdf/cv_taewon.pdf)!
